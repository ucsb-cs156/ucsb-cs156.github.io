# {{page.title}} - {{page.description}}

The website <https://developer.ucsb.edu> offers API access to a variety of UCSB data sources.

Two UCSB legacy code projects make use of these APIs:

* <https://ucsb-cs156/proj-courses>: A course search app
* <https://ucsb-cs156/proj-dining>: An app that shows dining commons menus and provides a way to leave reviews.

An API Key is required to use these APIs, and so is required to set up either of these apps.

Anyone with UCSB login credentials can create an API key; the information below explains how.

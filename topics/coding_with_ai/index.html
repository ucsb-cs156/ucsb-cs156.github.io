# {{page.title}} - {{page.description}}

The purpose of this page and its sub-articles is to gather information about
effective uses of AI agents (e.g. GitHub Copilot, Google Gemini, ChatGPT, Jetbrains Junie, etc.)
to assist with coding tasks in the context of CMPSC 156.

## Constructing prompts

When constructing prompts, it is important to provide the AI agent with as much context as possible.

Here's an example:

```
I need help with writing a test to cover a line of code.   Context: React, vite, vitest.


Here is the unit under test:

(Paste full contents of .js or .jsx file here)


Here is the test file:

(Paste full contents of .js or .jsx file here)


The line I need to cover is:

(Paste the line that is not covered.)

```

If the test provided by the agent doesn't work, follow up with the error message.

Note that it is not unusual to have to go through several rounds with the agent
before you get an correct solution.  When asking the AI to generate tests, it helps
to:
* Focus on one test at a time
* Read any information the agent gives you about the test, and try to understand the code and the test.  
  The agents are pretty good at getting to a solution *eventually*, but they often need human guidance
  in the form of your *human intelligence*.  
* Focus on using the agent as a way to learn more about writing good tests, and how testing works, 
  as opposed to using it to *avoid* learning those things.

# {{page.title}}

Timeboxed meeting (5-15 minutes), where everyone stands (to keep the meeting short)

# The three questions

* What tasks did you work on **yesterday** (or *since last standup*)
* What tasks will you commit to **today** (or *between now and next standup*) 
* Do you have any impediments/barriers/dependencies (anything that's preventing you from progressing)

# Norms

Each team should decide its own norms. You should decide on your own norms, but these are some norms that many teams find useful to commit to.

* One person talks at a time
* Be on time
* Keep it high level; avoid detail
   * Defer detailed conversations to later
* Avoid electronics (unless needed for reference)
* Avoid side conversations

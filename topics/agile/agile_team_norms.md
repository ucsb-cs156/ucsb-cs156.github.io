When an Agile team forms, it is customary to set **team norms** early in the team forming process.

# Moussa et al on Team Norms

The authors of the book <i>Committed Teams</i> (see reference below) discuss four questions to ask when setting up team norms:
* How will we handle conflict?
* How will we communicate?
* How will we make decisions?
* Have we focused on just a few rules that matter?

You are encouaged to check your team norms against these four questions, and revise as needed.

# Agile Simulation Team Norms Video

This 10 minute video 
illustrates setting team norms: [Agile Simulation - Part 3 | Purpose, Agenda, Team Norms](https://youtu.be/DcpyeafBkfQ)

The norms illustrated in the video, while common, are just examples.   

* The team norms should be chosen by the team itself, 
* Being a part of the team represents a committment to those norms.   
* Therefore, the norms should be ones that the team can come to consensus on.    
* Different teams will have slightly different team norms, based on the context, personality of the team members, level of experience, etc.

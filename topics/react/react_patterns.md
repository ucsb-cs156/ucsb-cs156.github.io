There are many *patterns* for writing components in React.   Here we present a few that you will find in our
code base:

We explains, among other things:
* Implementing a data entry form
* Implementing a data table
* Implementing a look ahead selector
* Implementing a drop down selector
* Simple component to just factor out some HTML

We have a separate article for implementing a top level page

# First a bit about the word *pattern*

We are abusing the term *pattern* a bit here.  Our usage doesn't exactly correspond to the usage of *pattern*
as it is used in the phrase *design patterns* in discussions of software engineering.

* If you are interested in exploring that, click the box below to open a longer discussion.  
* If you just want to get to the solution to your problem, you can skip over this for now.

Open this box for a discussion of how the word *pattern* is used on this page, 
and how that differs from the canonical use in Software Engineering.
</summary>

According to Wikipedia, in Software Engineering, a *pattern* is:

> ...a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. 
> It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. 
> Rather, it is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used 
> in many different situations. Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer
>  can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.

Examples of *design patterns* in Software Engineering include:
* Visitor Pattern
* Model-View-Controller Pattern
* Decorator Pattern
* Facade Pattern
* etc.

What we describe here doesn't correspond precisely to this formal definition of software design *pattern*, though it
does share some things in common:
* We do describe "commonly occuring problems" that occur in a given context (namely our Spring/React architecture)
* We do present examples of how to approach those problems, including sample code.

What this does *not* have in common with the usual accepted definition of pattern:
* Traditionally, patterns are usually described at a very high level of abstraction.  That's not what we do here.
* Instead, we provide specific examples of code to solve an instance of the problem, along with general advice of
  how to adapt the solution to your specific needs.
* Typically by the time something gets the name *design pattern*, it has been:
  - observed "in the wild" in many projects
  - has been implemented in multiple programming languages
  - is understood to be a "good practice", i.e. it has particular known advantages (and possibly pitfalls as well.)

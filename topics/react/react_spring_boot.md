For CMPSC 156, the staff have developed a pattern for combining a Spring Boot backend and a React Front end.

The basic pattern is illustrated in this repo, which has only a minimal shell of an app.  It implements OAuth login using
Google OAuth (which is available for everyone with a UCSB email address) as the provider, and little more.

There is also a more developed example here, as a "todo" items app.

Each of the three legacy code projects proceeds on the same basis, with the same basic code structure:

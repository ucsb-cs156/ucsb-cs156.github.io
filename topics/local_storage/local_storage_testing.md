# {{page.title}} - {{page.description}}

Here are some examples of writing jest tests that involve local storage.

## Disclaimer

Keep in mind that all code examples on this page were up-to-date at the time they were posted, but that the
code base is ever changing.  We have used "github permalinks" to link to the source code *as it was* at the time
these were collated.

## Clearing `localStorage` in `beforeEach`

You may want to clear `localStorage` in the `beforeEach` of your test so that each test starts from empty local storage.

This example is from [frontend/src/tests/components/PersonalSchedules/PersonalScheduleSelector.test.js](https://github.com/ucsb-cs156/proj-courses/blob/55f42a4f2d31dd0b785e51bf23a202ce82add854/frontend/src/tests/components/PersonalSchedules/PersonalScheduleSelector.test.js#L12)

```js
 beforeEach(() => {
    localStorage.clear();
    // ... other code might go here
  });
```

## Mocking `localStorage` 

You can use this lines of code to create a jest `mock` for localStorage:

```js
    const getItemSpy = jest.spyOn(Storage.prototype, "getItem");
```

If you want your mock to always return a specific value, say `"1"`, you can create a mock implementation:

```
    getItemSpy.mockImplementation(() => "1");
```

An example can be found in [frontend/src/tests/components/PersonalSchedules/PersonalScheduleDropdown.test.js](https://github.com/ucsb-cs156/proj-courses/blob/55f42a4f2d31dd0b785e51bf23a202ce82add854/frontend/src/tests/components/PersonalSchedules/PersonalScheduleDropdown.test.js#L123) (See: [Disclaimer](#Disclaimer)). 

If your mock implementation needed to be more sophisticated, you could set up an object with the mapping of what you expect to be in `localStorage`,
and then return `null` if the key is not found:

```
    getItemSpy.mockImplementation((key) => {
       const values = {
         "key1" : JSON.stringify("value1"),
         "key2" : JSON.stringify("value1")
       }
       return ( key in values ? values[key] : null );
    });
```

## Expect tests on`localStorage` values

We can use expect clauses on `localStorage` to check that the values were set correctly:

```
    expect(localStorage.getItem("controlId")).toBe("schedule2");
```

Here's an example that shows this in context: 

It comes from: [`frontend/src/tests/components/PersonalSchedules/PersonalScheduleSelector.test.js`](https://github.com/ucsb-cs156/proj-courses/blob/55f42a4f2d31dd0b785e51bf23a202ce82add854/frontend/src/tests/components/PersonalSchedules/PersonalScheduleSelector.test.js)

First, we [clear `localStorage` in the `beforeEach`]  on  [this line](https://github.com/ucsb-cs156/proj-courses/blob/55f42a4f2d31dd0b785e51bf23a202ce82add854/frontend/src/tests/components/PersonalSchedules/PersonalScheduleSelector.test.js)

```js
beforeEach(() => {
    localStorage.clear();
    // other code
  });
```

Then, in the [test](https://github.com/ucsb-cs156/proj-courses/blob/55f42a4f2d31dd0b785e51bf23a202ce82add854/frontend/src/tests/components/PersonalSchedules/PersonalScheduleSelector.test.js#L45), we render the component, click on a certain element, and then `expect` the `localStorage` value to have been set correctly:

```js
 test("updates the schedule state and calls setSchedule when a schedule is selected", () => {
    const setSchedule = jest.fn();
    render(
      <PersonalScheduleSelector
        controlId="controlId"
        setSchedule={setSchedule}
      />,
    );
    fireEvent.change(screen.getByLabelText("Schedule"), {
      target: { value: "schedule2" },
    });
    expect(localStorage.getItem("controlId")).toBe("schedule2");
    expect(setSchedule).toHaveBeenCalledWith("schedule2");
  });
```

## Legacy Stryker exceptions

You may encounter code in the code base where a Stryker exception was used to 
bypass mutation testing for code involving localStorage.   **This should no longer be done**, and code that
contains such exceptions **should be updated to test using the techniques explained earlier on this page**.

Here's an example (which, we can hope, by the time you read this, may already be fixed):

```
 // Stryker disable all : not sure how to test/mock local storage
  const localSchedule = localStorage.getItem("CourseForm-psId");
  const [schedule, setSchedule] = useState(localSchedule || "");
  if (schedule) {
    localStorage.setItem("CourseForm-psId", schedule);
  }
  // Stryker restore all
```

## Static Analysis

It would be interesting to incorporate static analysis into the course in a variety of ways.

For example:

* Can we use incorporate static analysis tools to find ways to improve the code bases?
* Can we incorporate static analysis tool into the CI/CD pipeline

We will need to focus on static analysis tools that are either open source and free, or have a free version available for students/teachers/open-source.

Some candidates:

* <https://pvs-studio.com/en/order/for-students/>
* <https://pmd.github.io/>

Stryker-JS is a mutation framework for JavaScript.

* It is documented here: <https://stryker-mutator.io/docs/stryker-js/introduction>
* It was previously just called Stryker, but then the framework grew to incorporate mutation testing
  for C# and and Scala programs as well, so they rebranded Stryker as Stryker-JS to avoid confusion.

GitHub allows developers to create "issues" associated with a repo.

Issues typically fall into one of three categories:
* Features to be added to a piece of software
* Bugs that need to be fixed in the software
* Proposals for refactoring (i.e. no change in functionality, but an improvement to the code structure)

Some teams also use issues for tracking "todo" items that fall outside the scope of making changes to code, e.g. for doing design, presentations, research, etc. 

Issues can be tracked on the Projects in GitHub, which functions like a Kanban board.

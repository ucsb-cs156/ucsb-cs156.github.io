If you took CMPSC 156 and left feeling "I want more!", you may want consider asking your instructors about
opportunities to do a CMPSC 192 or CMPSC 196 course to continue your learning.

In a 192/196 course, the relationship between student/professsor is typically more of an "apprenticeship/supervisor" relationship
than the student/teacher relationship you find in a traditional course.  It resembles the way that professors work with graduate students on research,
so it is good way to explore whether research and/or graduate study may be something you want to pursue.

# What do you do in a 192/196

For a 192, projects may typically include:

* Working on the [Spring/React future work](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/spring_react/future_work.html) projects
  (projects to extend the capabilities of the code base used for CMPSC projects, either to allow more functionality for end users,
  improve the quality of the code base,
  or to increase/improve opportunities for future CMPSC 156 so that their learning of software engineering is broader, deeper,
  or both.)
* Working on the existing [Legacy Code Projects](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/legacy_code/legacy_code_projects.html) on features
  bug fixes or refactorings that would not fit into the usual structure of the course, either because they
  - require more sustained attention than the three week time span for the legacy code phase of CMPSC 156
  - require global updates to the code base that would be difficult to accomplish during the course (too many merge conflicts)
  - are technically more difficult that the usual expectations of CMPSC 156 (where projects have to be accessible to students
    that may be novices to full-stack web development).
* Working on [New Legacy Code Projects](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/legacy_code/legacy_code_projects.html#possible-future-applications)&mdash;we
  introduce new legacy code applications from time-to-time; we typically try to provide at least some partial work towards
  a "minimum viable product" (MVP) when introducing these new applications, so that students get the legacy code experience. 

For a 196, work may include any of the items above, but there needs to be a "research angle".  Additionally, 196 students may 
choose to get involved in some of the publishable work done by Prof. Conrad related to CMPSC 156, including but not limited to
* Studies of the use of testing in CMPSC 156.  Examples of past work:
  - [Teaching Testing with Modern Technology Stacks in Undergraduate Software Engineering Courses](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3430665.3456352)
* Studies that analyze chat transcripts (Slack) from CMPSC 156, for example:
  - [Investigating Reflection in Undergraduate Software Development Teams: An Analysis of Online Chat Transcripts](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3545945.3569790)
* Studies that analyze how to evaluate equity of individual contributions to team projects, for example:
  - [Evaluating Commit, Issue and Product Quality in Team Software Development Projects](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3408877.3432362)
  - [Assessing individual contributions to software engineering projects: a replication study](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08993408.2022.2071543?tab=permissions&scroll=top)

There are other research questions as well related to CMPSC 156 that can be posed and investigated using artifacts from CMPSC 156 (with informed consent)&mdash; if you have
ideas, pitch them!

# Can I apply 192/196 to major field electives?

For CoE Computer Science majors (CMPSC) and 
College of Creative Studies Computing Majors, the answer is "yes, but only up to four units".

See the version of [UCSB CoE GEAR](https://engineering.ucsb.edu/undergraduate/academic-advising/gear-publications) for the year you
matriculated (i.e. became a full-time student at UCSB) for the official rules; here's a screenshot of the rule that applies
from the 2023-2024 GEAR:

Also: while 192 and 196 can be taken P/NP or for a letter grade, you must take them for a letter grade in order to apply them
to major field electives.

For other majors, e.g. Computer Engineering (CMPEN), please consult your home department's advising staff
(e.g. ECE for CMPEN majors) before enrolling to determine whether or not the course will satisfy degree requirements. 

# How are 192 / 196 courses evaluated

(Note that the content of this section is a personal view of Prof. Phill Conrad, and not official university policy.)

The form for proposing a 192/196 requires the instructor and student to agree on evaluation criteria.  I typically put something like this:

> To evaluate student work and learning, Instructor will examine
> artifacts produced by the students including software, written documents,
> and if applicable, oral presentations, and assign an appropriate letter grade.

I should point out that awarding letter grades in 192/196 courses is different from regular undergrad courses. 
Regular courses typically have
a detailed syllabus with a breakdown of how much each component is worth; numerical scores are assigned to each
component, and then a grade is calcuated.  Typically, nothing like that happens for 192 / 196 work.  

Instead, the instructor and student agree on some high level goals at the start of the course; they then meet periodically
to set smaller intermediate goals.  However, evaluation is informal, and ongoing.

The typical grade for students in independent studies is an A, mainly because of two forms of selection bias:
- Typically, only highly-motivated/high-acheieving students propose independent studies
- Instructors have discretion to say yes/no, and typically only take on high achieving students

But the A is not automatic: it must be earned.  And unlike in a course with numerical components, the 
way that is done is typically more subjective.  The independent study implies an unwritten handshake agreement 
between the student and the professor that they trust each other: 
* the professor trusts the student to be diligent and hard working
* the student trusts the professor to evaluate their work fairly. 

Before you propose (or agree to) an independent study, both parties should ask themselves whether they are prepared to
extend that level of trust to one another, and proceed only if the answer is enthusiastically yes.


# Should I choose 192 or 196?

For most students, 192 is the better choice; it is more flexibile in at least three ways:

* Work *may* be publishable, but doesn't *have to* be (it must be for 196).
* There is an ability to trade off units vs. letter grades
* Fewer requirements for written/oral presentations

More on each of these below, then a discussion of the limited circumstances where a 196 may be a better choice.

## 192 vs 196: Is it "research"

Both courses have an implicit requirement that the student is learning something signifcant and doing work worthy of four units of 
upper division&mdash;that's a baseline that they both share.

But for 196 there is an *additional* implicit requirement (via the course title) that the work be connected to "research"&mdash;i.e. the investigation of 
something novel and significant that can be published in a peer-reviewed venue, such as a conference or a journal.  The work done has to 
have a significance beyond just that the student "worked hard and learned something".

Note that a student *may* still undertake "research-worthy" work as part of a CMPSC 192&mdash;and if that work results in a publication, very
few people will care whether it was done as part of a 192 or 196 course.

## 192 allows unit/grade tradeoffs in some circumstances.

Consider a circumstance that is rare, but can occur, where due to circumstances beyond your control, you are unable to follow
through on your original committment, and the *quantity* of work is signficantly lower than the expectations 
for a four unit upper division course. 

With a 192, there is the option to award, say, 2 units of work rather than 4. And, if the work is of high *quality* (just not *enough* of it 
for four units), the associated letter grade could be an A.   That still leaves the option to do two more units of work later to count the work towards
major field electives.   

By contrast, if the course is a 196, there is no variable unit option; the only choices in the circumstances described above would be either:
* drop the course completely, and get no credit for the work already done
* take a reduced grade for 4 units (e.g. a C or D).

Note the scenario described here assumes work of high *quality*.  If the work is of *low quality*, 
a reduced number of units for a higher grade that the work deserve is not really an appropriate option.  
The standard for getting *any* credit for 192 / 196 work is always high.

# 196 requires extra oral/written presentations

For 196, there is a specific requirement for a formal written report and formal oral presentations.  

Note that for 192, the instructor *may still require* some writing and/or oral reports at their discretion, but 
this can be a point of discussion between student and instructor, and the instructor has disrection to impose this
requirement or not.

By contrast, there's no instructor discretion for a 196; the student must produce a formal written report and
make an oral presentation of their work.

## When would 196 be the better choice?

The only cases I have encountered where taking 196 might be preferred:

* If the student specifically *needs* 196 credit for some specfic program that requires it (e.g. Engineering Honors, DIMAPS, etc.)
* If the student really, really, wants "Research" on their transcript (though note that if you end up as a co-author on a publication,
  that's *far* more significant to, for example, potential grad school programs than what's on your transcript.)

# How do I apply?

* Start with an email and/or Slack message to Prof. Conrad.
* Be persistent; his email gets full, and it's easy for things to get missed
* Agree on the general parameters informally first:
  - General project outline
  - Time frame
  - 192 or 196
* Then fill out a formal [192/ 196 petition](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/documents/CS%20Undergraduates%20Special%20Projects%20Proposal.pdf)
* That will be submitted to the CS office; they'll respond with an add code.
* You must add yourself to the course with the add code! They don't automatically add you.
* Make sure the course shows up on GOLD

# Once I'm registered, then what?

* Contact the instructor to set up a schedule of work.
* Check in at least once a week&mdash;probably *more often*, but *at least* once at week to report progress, and ask for feedback, and new goals.

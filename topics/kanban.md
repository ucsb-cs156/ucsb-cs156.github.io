Kanban is a system for visualizing work in progress. 
* It's origins are in systems for improving efficiency and quality in Japanese manufacturing 
* In Software Development, it is often associated with Agile, Lean and eXtreme Programming (XP) approaches.

A classic Kanban board is a whiteboard or a wall, with columns, and post-it notes, as in the image below:

The following set of videos related a User Story Mapping exercise to setting up a Kanban board using the Project feature
of github:

* Part 1 (12:12) (Planning): <https://youtu.be/IsuIZaqnIuU>
   * Kanban doesn't really appear in this video, but watching this one is necessary for the context
* Part 2 (10:15) (Using a Github Project Kanban Board): <https://youtu.be/8U0FezxxMGU>
   * This one centers around setting up a Kanban board on Github.
* Part 3 (16:28) (More User Stories and Issues): <https://youtu.be/lIB0WJzgSs8>
   * More detail.

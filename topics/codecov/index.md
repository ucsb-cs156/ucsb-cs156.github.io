The website <https://codecov.io> is a commerical tool (free for open source, and free to students for closed source through the 
[GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/students) that provides 
integrated tools to group, merge, archive, and compare coverage reports.

In CS156, we use codecov.io primarily to:
* Give us a unified view of test coverage across both Java and JavaScript tools
  - You can get a view of Java code coverage through Jacoco and or Pitest
  - You can get a view of JavaScript code coverage through Jest 
  - The value added from codecov is to see those views integrated into one visualization.
* Provide a way for course staff (instructors, TAs, LAs) to see code coverage info for private student repos.
* To provide a way for pair partners and teams to share code coverage info for private student repos.

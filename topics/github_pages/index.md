At some later date, I hope we will write some documentaiton here about Github Pages for CS156.

For now this is a just a placeholder for the following link

## Link for dependencies

Github used to publish a human readable list of the versions of all of the Jekyll dependencies for Github Pages at this URL:

* <https://pages.github.com/versions>

But, sometime in late 2025, they put a redirect on that page, and now you can't see it anymore.  Sad.  

However!  They have always had a JSON version of that page too, and it has NOT gone away. Here's the link:

* <https://pages.github.com/versions.json>

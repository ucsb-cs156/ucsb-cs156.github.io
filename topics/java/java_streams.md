# Contrary Opinions

Not everyone is fully on the bandwagon with the new functional programming style.  And that's probably a good thing.  We want to make sure to avoid treating every problem as a nail just because we have a shiny new hammer.

Read these too, and form your own opinions&mdash;but don't hold onto those opinions too tightly.  Take everything you read seriously, but not literally.

Migrating a large code base from one Java version to another can be a significant undertaking.  In Fall 2024, we manage to move one of our existing legacy code projects from Java 17 to Java 21,
but the remaining projects could not be migrated in time.

Therefore, for some period of time, it was necessary for the staff and some of the students to be able to switch easily and quickly between Java 17 and Java 21.

Fortunately, there is a tool that helps with this called `SDKMAN`.

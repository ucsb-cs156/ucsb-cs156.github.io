When installing anything on a Linux system (or any kind of Unix system), it is usually best to use the appropriate package manager
for the specific distribution.

Advice on installing node for particular distributions can be found here: <https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/>

(If there is any additional platform specific advice for Linux, it should be added to this page.)

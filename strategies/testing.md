# Testing Strategies

## Focus on one failing test at a time

If you have a large number of failing tests, the output can get overwhelming. This will slow you down.

Instead, try to focus on one test at a time.  Here are specific strategies for doing that:

**Backend**: Use a command like this to run only one set of backend tests.  Here `FooControllerTests` is the name of the test class (not the unit under test):

```
mvn test -Dtest=FooControllerTests
```

You can further limit the run to a single test by using:

```
mvn test -Dtest=FooControllerTests\#method_name_of_test
```

You can also limit the tests by commenting out all tests, and uncommenting them one at a time.  Each time a test fails, focus on fixing that one until they all pass.

**Frontend**: You can use this command to focus on tests for one file at a time. In this case, the expression after the `--` is treated as a regular expression, so you only need as many characters as are needed to match what you are testing:

```
npm test -- FooTable
```

You can further control which tests run by changing code as follows:

| Change this | To This | For this result |
|-|-|-|
| `test(...)` | `test.only(...)` | Only this test will run. If there are multiple tests marked with `.only`, that set of tests will run |
| `test(...)` | `test.skip(...)` | Skip this test. |


You can also apply `.only` and `.skip` to entire `describe` blocks, and to tests marked with `it` instead of `test`.

## Maybe the test is right and the code is wrong

If you are trying to figure out why a test is not passing, and you are stuck, ask yourself this question:

* Is it possible that the test is *right* and the *code* is wrong?

Things to try:
* If this is a frontend test: do you have a storybook entry for the component? If so, try walking through all of the steps of the test in the storybook component. (If you don't have a storybook entry yet, make one; that process may help you discover what you've missed).
* Try actually running the code *for real* with the full backend and frontend, either on `localhost` or a `dokku` deployment.  Does the code actually *do* what it's supposed to do?
